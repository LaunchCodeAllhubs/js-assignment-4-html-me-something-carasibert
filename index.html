               <p>Cutting and soldering your own stained glass creation is easier than it seems. <br>
                        In this article, you will learn the tools that you will need and the basic steps to get started. <br>
                        My dad and I recently took a class on getting started with stained glass, and this hobby is great for all skill levels and a wide range of ages. </p>

               <h2>Design</h2>
               <img src = ".github\images\making pattern.jpg" id = "making pattern"/>
                  <p>There are endless designs that you can make with stained glass. For the class, each student had the choice to create a moth or a butterfly. 
                     I chose to create a moth, while my dad chose to create a butterfly.
                  </p>
                  <p>Once you have chosen your design, print the image to the dimensions of the glass that you are working with. Then, trace the pattern onto the glass using a thick black marker.
                     If you are creating an intricate piece, it can also be helpful to number each of your sections of glass in order to remember where each piece goes.

               <h2>Cutting the Glass</h2>
               <img src = ".github\images\scoring.jpg" id = "scoring glass"/>
                  <p>Using a ruler, align your glass cutter so that the wheel is aligned over the glass you are cutting. </p>
                  <p>Begin at the edge of the glass and use the scoring tool to score in a single movement along the line that you are cutting. 
                     It is best to do this in a continuous motion so that you have more control over where your glass will break.</p>
                  <img src = ".github\images\breaking.jpg" id = "breaking glass"/>
                  <p>You can either break the glass along the score by holding it on each side and snapping it with your hands or by using your pliers to put pressure on the score line by lining up the middle of the pliers with the line you are trying to break and squeezing.</p>
                  <p>Curved lines can be more difficult to cut, but can be scored in a similar way to straight lines, by scoring from one edge to the other along the line you want to cut. 
                     With curved lines, it is easier to use pliers to break the glass with more accuracy.

               <a name="grinding"></a>
               <h2>Grinding the Glass</h2>
                  <p>Once all pieces have been cut, you can take the pieces to the grinding wheel to gently grind away the rough edges and fine tune the shapes, being careful not to apply too much pressure. </p>
                  <p>To ensure that all the the pieces fit snugly, align them in the original pattern, and make adjustments. It is acceptable for there to be small gaps in the pattern, as these can be filled in with solder later.</p>

               <h2>Adding the Foil</h2>
               <img src = ".github\images\foilingpiece.JPG" id = "foiling piece"/>
                  <p>The next step is to use the foil tape to foil all of the pieces. </p>
                  <p>Once you have decided on the thickness of the copper foil for your glass, peel the protective backing off of the foil. 
                     Center your glass on the tape and press it securely against the edges of the glass. 
                     Rub the edges of the foil along the front and back edges of the glass, and ensure that the tape is securely attached and even. </p>

            <section id = "soldering">
               <a name="soldering"></a>
               <h2>Soldering the Glass</h2>
                  <p>There are a series of steps associated with soldering the glass: 
                     <li>Adding the flux</li>
                     <li>Tacking the corners</li>
                     <li>Tinning the seams</li>
                     <li>Finishing with bead soldering</li>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Adding the flux</h3>
                  <p>Flux must be applied to the copper foil before soldering. It is easiest to use a small paint brush to apply the flux along the edges of each piece of glass. 
                     The flux helps to ensure that the tinned wire is applied smoothly. As you are soldering, if you notice that your tinned wire is not melting smoothly, try applying more flux.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Tacking the corners </h3>
                  <img src = ".github\images\tackingcorners.JPG" id = "tacking corners"/>
                  <p>Once you have applied flux to the piece, tack the corners of each piece together by using the soldering iron to melt a small blob of solder on top of the corner. It is acceptable for this to look messy at first!
                        This ensures that your piece will be stabilized as you solder the remaining seams.</p>
                  <h3>Tinning the Seams</h3>
                  <img src = ".github\images\solderingedges.JPG" id = "tinning seams"/>
                  <p>Once all of the corners are tacked together, you can begin to tin the seams. Use the soldering iron to melt a thin, flat amount of solder to the seams, completely coating all of the copper foil. It is helpful to do one side of the piece at once, then turn the piece over once cooled and do the remaining side.</p>
                  <h3>Finishing with bead soldering</h3>
                  <p>To create the bead solder, apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams. Melt a larger amount of solder to the seams, and then run the soldering iron back and forth along a section to create a smoother melted seam of solder.
                     Once the section is completely melted, gently lift the soldering iron from the piece to create a smooth, shiny bead. This takes practices, but the solder and iron are very forgiving!

            <section id = "patina">
               <a name="patina"></a>
               <h2>Adding the Patina</h2>
               <img src = ".github\images\applying patina.JPG" id = "applying patina"/>
               <p>Adding a patina finish is optional, but can pull a piece together by creating a dark chemical reaction to creating a black finish to your solder. Take a q-tip or paint brush and apply a layer of patina to your piece. Once complete, take a wet toothbrush and scrub the excess patina and flux off of your piece. </p>

               <h2 id = "testP">Hanging your Art</h2>
               <img src = ".github\images\finalpiece.jpg" id = "hanging"/>
               <p>To hang the piece, cut two pieces of tinned copper wire and use pliers to shape them into loops. Solder a small bead of tinned wire to attach the hanging wire to the piece.</p>
